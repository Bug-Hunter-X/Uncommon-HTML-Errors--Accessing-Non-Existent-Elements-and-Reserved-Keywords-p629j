  <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
  <div id="myDiv"></div>
  <script>
    //Incorrect way to access a non-existent element
    document.getElementById("myDiv").innerHTML = "Hello, world!";
    //This will work, however it is not the best practice
    document.querySelector("#myDiv").innerHTML = "Hello, world!";

    //Another uncommon error is the use of reserved keywords as identifiers
    let class = "myClass"; // class is a reserved keyword and should not be used as a variable name
    let for = 10; // for is a reserved keyword and should not be used as a variable name
